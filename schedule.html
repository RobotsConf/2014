      	<p>After a long day of travel, join us and your fellow attendees at the local restaurant, <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland/Dining/FalconsNest.aspx">The Falcon's Nest</a>. Full of incredible aviation memorabilia, billiard tables, and TVs, the Falcon's Nest has something for everyone - even if just sitting out on the deck strikes your fancy. We will have appetizers and communal food offerings available for you to munch on. It is a quick (~2 minute) walk from the hotel and we look forward to seeing you there!</p>

        <h4><span class='time'>10:45AM - 4:15PM</span> :: Workshop Surveys and Open Makerspace</h4>
        <p>The remainder of the scheduled events for the day will be a blend of surveys and small group hands-on sessions working through specific workshops. During this time you will identify your small group that you will be working with, kick around ideas, or just decide to build out your bot dreams and bring them to life. </p>

        <h5>About the Workshop Surveys</h5>
        <p>The "workshop surveys", as we call them, are designed to provide you with a quick, rapid fire overview of each of the major segments within the Maker movement. By the end of this period you will be knowledgeable about all of the areas and hopefully have identified a small subset that deeply interest or excite you. The goal of these workshops isn't necessarily to explain everything in 20 minutes (an impossible task), but to give you enough insight to know if you need to return to the workshop later to accomplish your robotic goals! Think of it as speed dating for the maker movement. This year, they are opt-in surveys that allow you to gather the information that you want and will be held in our <b>Lecture Room</b>  (same as the keynote speakers).
        <h5>About the Makerspace</h5>
        <p>The pop-up <b>makerspace</b> will be open during this time as well for anyone that wants to begin building and will be right next to the lecture room! If you have an idea and a team, you can start breadboarding and soldering items together to build your invention, otherwise use this time to form a team (or go solo, that is perfectly fine!) and come up with what you are going to build. During the open hack, you will have you have access to the best possible people in your preferred language there to help (and independence for when you don't) as well as all of the workshop experts. There will be drones available to hack on, solder stations ready to connect metal, and more servos than you can possibly imagine. The evening will buzz with the excitement and energy that only comes when you are building your very own electronic inventions.</p>

        <p>To kick this off we will have quick entry level tutorial period that will dive much deeper into the beginning steps of hardware hacking, allowing everyone to build and control a robot in under an hour. This is completely optional, but strongly recommended if this is your first time with hardware OR it has been a while since you last dabbled in hardware. We will be taking a tour of the Popup Makerspace during this time period with the group. If you do not attend the session, you will be allowed to travel with tour group if you want!</p>
        <h4><span class='time'>4:15PM - 1:00AM</span> :: Open Presentations</h4>
        <p>At this time we will have an open spaces style "sign up to speak" portion that will use our presentation space, so if you want a deep dive on something OR you want to provide a deep dive on something, just sign up and speak! </p>

        <p>RobotsConf is not just about soldering components together, but also about bringing people together. As such, PwC is providing you with a great evening social event, while still allowing you to participate in the Open Hack night (or just discuss and watch). Right in the same area as the open hack event, we will be hosting a pizza party for everyone so you can grab a slice (or a couple) and head back to building or enjoy the cool night air -- entirely up to you. If you want to take a complete break from the day, there will be fires going around the heated pool... so there is that option.</p>

        <p>For those so inclined, we will be hosting the first of two sumobot tournaments. The first will be  at 8:00PM with bots controlled by our invited experts. The tournament is a great way to start down a path of building something that you can then compete and evolve over time. For an example of what a sumobot tournament will look like, see below:</p>

We will provide food and refreshments throughout the day so you can stay at the top of your hacking. If you finish early or just want to declare you bot complete, you can go learn more at each of the workshop stations or offer to support any of the sumobot teams as the battle to the championships. We want everyone to have a great time and to learn and experience as much as possible while we have the experts and hardware readily available, so if you have time and desire to start another project, please get to it! You are only confined by your motivation and the amount of time we have the space.</p>

Enjoy an absolutely amazing evening out on the marsh with all of your new roboticist friends while you dine on local cuisine. You don't have to worry about walking their, you can take the local bus system - or if you want a rather nice bike ride, you can also bike there. See you there!</p>
