  title: OculusHead (Keynote)
  body: >
    The project is a 3D printed robotic head for a telepresence immersive experience, the project includes movement of the 3D printed head and computer vision. Using the accelerometer that the Oculus Rift headset provides we are moving several servos that have webcams mounted, the goal is to mimic remotely the moves of a person wearing the headset. We have a node.js apps that obtains this data, process it and translate it to actuators plugged to an Arduino, OculusHead have movement on 3-axis with servos simulating almost all of the possible movements of a human head.
    For the vision part we are using two webcams mounted on the servo system that can see in the same direction the user sees, this is real time streamed to a computer and can be visualized on the Oculus Rift headset plugged to this computer in a different location that the OculusHead is located. There are several filters applied to the source image to give the full immersive experience including the depth that's needed for the headset.
    The software part is implemented using JavaScript and node.js and libraries like vr.js, three.js, johnny-five and socket.io. We are currently working on printing a full head (based on InMoov project) and implementing more features of computer vision like face recognition and more image processing.

    Making something is easy; making something that can be made is hard – very hard" (quote Sonny Vu). Hardware takes longer, costs a lot and requires more people. It can be perilous for a company, but the rewards can be great. This talk outlines some of the pitfalls (mfg, pricing, retail) that have befallen hardware companies in the past – and still do today.

  title: Becoming A Maker
  body: >
    I intend to talk for a little bit about my own journey to becoming a Maker (becoming a software engineer, finding a hackerspace accidentally, getting to know people, taking classes) and then give a partially-serious, partially-humourous list and set of anecdotes on "things that happen/how you change when you become a Maker" (serious things like how my job widened and I had new opportunities at work and humourous things like "covert bathroom soldering" and "sparkfun evangelism").
  bio: >
    Working for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Kennedy Space Center as a Computer Engineer, Jamie Szafran works on projects like the Spaceport Command and Control System and in the SwampWorks rapid prototyping lab. Outside of work, she's a half-marathoner and triathlete, a professionally-trained and performing musician, a self-styled programming language theorist, and the treasurer and a member of FamiLAB, Orlando's hackerspace. Most importantly, she's a puzzle-solver, a teacher, and a lifelong student.
    
    Jamie got started with science and software tinkering early, but didn't get into the hardware world and really consider herself a Maker until after she found FamiLAB and started learning about electronics and the Maker Movement. Since then, she's gone from being a software developer who'd never heard of the word "Arduino" to teaching soldering at Maker Faire Orlando, giving talks on topics ranging from NASA's future to hackerspace history, attending her first Maker Faire, competing in hackathons, and learning new ways to let the magic smoke out.
